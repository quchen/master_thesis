\section*{Statement of Originality}

I hereby certify that I am the sole author of the text of this thesis. The ideas contained however are based on collaboration with others, most notably my advisor Prof. Dr. Haye Hinrichsen, with whom -- together with myself -- much of the content was published beforehand \cite{thingie-paper, flow-paper}.
