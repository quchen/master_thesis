Master thesis
=============

This is my master thesis in physics, created from October 2012 to October 2013, under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Haye Hinrichsen][hinrichsen] at the [University of Würzburg][uni-wue].

The general field is statistical physics, and the thesis in particular is concerned with how irreversible processes create, and possibly destroy, entropy in the environment.

Numbers contained
-----------------

Since I kept joking that I didn’t touch any numbers greater than two in my
thesis, I decided to count them (`count-all-numbers` script), so here’s the
histogram of all numbers contained in my thesis.

 - 0: 153
 - 1: 211
 - 2: 314
 - 3: 46
 - 4: 12
 - 5: 8
 - 7: 2
 - 8: 3
 - 10: 4
 - 18: 1
 - 19: 1
 - 50: 1
 - 56: 1
 - 100: 1

So I am capable of using 3s after all. Cool!
