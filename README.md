Master thesis
=============

This is my master thesis in physics, created from October 2012 to October 2013, under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Haye Hinrichsen][hinrichsen] at the [University of WÃ¼rzburg][uni-wue].

The general field is statistical physics, and the thesis in particular is concerned with how irreversible processes create, and possibly destroy, entropy in the environment.
